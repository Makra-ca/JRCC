<p>For over 60 years JVS Toronto has been helping people from all backgrounds and with diverse needs to identify their professional strengths and goals, develop skills and achieve success in school, work and life. For the last three years, the JRCC has been working with the JVS Toronto to bring this valuable service to the JRCC community.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many people in our community who have tremendous skills and know-how, but they might not have the connections they need or the ability to market themselves,&rdquo;&ldquo;This service helps people polish how the present themselves to prospective employers, gives them guidance about how they can upgrade their skills, and provides access to government and other resources to help those seeking employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In partnership with the JRCC, personal appointments are available with JVS professionals every Tuesday at the JRCC, offering a wide variety of employment services including job search support, resumes, interview coaching, job development, specialized group workshops, career counseling and exploration.</p>

<p>(The JVS at the JRCC initiative is part of the JRCC&rsquo;s continuously evolving commitment to provide increased access to social services to Jews from the former Soviet Union and their families residing in Ontario. To learn more or to volunteer your unique talents or expertise to benefit members of our community, please contact us.)</p>
