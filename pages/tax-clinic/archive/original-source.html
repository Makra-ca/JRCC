<p>During the upcoming tax season, the Jewish Russian Community Centre will be offering a free program to prepare income tax and benefits returns for members of the community who are unable to afford the services of an income tax professional. This service is provided by our volunteer accountants. There will be a limited number of spaces in this program, and JRCC is not looking to take business away from professional service providers, so only community members who are in need are urged to utilize this free service.</p>

<p>We can provide this service to community members that come from low-income households.</p>

<p>Individuals with a $25 K and family $35K (or less) combined yearly income are eligible for our services.</p>

<p>We are unable to provide this service in-person. This service is available by appointment only. We ask clients to drop-off the following at JRCC Headquarters: (1) previous year's notice of assessment from CRA, (2) previous year's tax return, (3) previous year's lease agreement or property tax deal, (4) tax slips received by mail for the current year, and (5) medical receipts or a summary of medical expenses from their pharmacy for the current year. Once the income tax and/or benefits returns are ready, we will notify the client to come pick them up.</p>

<p>Please contact us for more information.</p>
