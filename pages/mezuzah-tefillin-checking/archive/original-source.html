<p>Mezuzot and tefillin are essential mitzvot, bringing holiness and protection. However, over time, ink may fade, letters can crack, and exposure to the elements can make them invalid.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Why Check Them?</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Jewish law requires mezuzot to be checked twice every seven years; tefillin should be checked if there are concerns about their condition.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A non-kosher mezuzah or tefillin does not fulfill the mitzvah.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Regular checks ensure they remain intact and valid.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><br />
<strong>How It Works?</strong></h3>

<p>A certified sofer carefully examines the parchment, ensuring it meets halachic standards. Any necessary repairs are made before returning them.</p>

<h3><br />
Pricing for the service</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mezuzah Check: from $14 per mezuzah</li>
	<li>Tefillin Check: $100 (if additional repairs necessary - a few dollars before the cost will be added)</li>
</ul>

<p>If tefillin/mezuzah is determined not kosher no cost will apply.&nbsp;</p>
