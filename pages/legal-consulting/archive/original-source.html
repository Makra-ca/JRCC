<p>The Jewish Russian Community Centre is offering free virtual legal consultations for community members who are unable to afford legal services. Thanks to our volunteer lawyers we are able to provide these legal services free of charge. As JRCC is not looking to take business away from professional service providers, only community members who are in need are urged to utilize this free service.<br />
Legal consultations are available by appointment. Each appointment is 30 minutes and occurs virtually (via Zoom) until further notice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please contact us for more information.</p>
