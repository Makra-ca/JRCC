<h2><span style="color:#3498db;">Binding mind, heart and deed</span></h2>

<p>The Mitzvah that binds our minds with our hearts and deeds, and allows a daily reunification within ourselves and with G-d. Tefillin: the what, the why, and the how-to.</p>

A set includes two&mdash;one for the head and one for the arm. Each consists of three main components: the scrolls, the box and the strap.&nbsp;<b> <a href="https://www.Jrcc.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1918251/jewish/What-Are-Tefillin.htm">Read more about tefillin</a></b></p>

<p align="left">When you put on tefillin, you&rsquo;ll be connecting to the Infinite, fulfilling G‑d&rsquo;s will and reminding yourself to be a better person. But you&rsquo;ll also be doing something that your great-great-grandfather did in exactly the same way. And when you do it, you&rsquo;re increasing the chances that your great-great-grandchildren will want to do it too. Those straps don&rsquo;t connect you just to G‑d; they connect you to your past, to your future, to your people.</p>
