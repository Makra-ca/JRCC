<p>Have you recently immigrated to Canada? We would like to officially welcome you and help you integrate into our community. New immigrants may not be fully aware of the services our community has to offer, so the Jewish Russian Community Centre (JRCC) is providing welcome meetings to guide immigrants to services that can improve their lives in Canada.<br />
  These meetings include a walk-through of all the services that are offered in our community &ndash; at JRCC and other Jewish community services &ndash; that may aid you and your family in your transition. We also assess your needs and give you referrals to partner agencies that offer the services you require. The meetings occur virtually (e.g., Zoom) or via a phone call until further notice.</p>
  
  <p>If you are interested in scheduling a welcome meeting, please contact us.</p>
