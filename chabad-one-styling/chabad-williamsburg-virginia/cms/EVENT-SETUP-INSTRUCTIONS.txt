FULL EXAMPLE

Sora Vigorito is one of only 89 pairs of identical twins who were
subjected to the cruel medical experiments conducted by Dr. Joseph
Mengele in Auschwitz. As a young child, she endured unimaginable
loss, trauma, and separation, yet emerged with extraordinary
strength and determination.

Her life story is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for
survival, healing, and renewal. Through decades of rebuilding,
Sora transformed profound devastation into a life rooted in faith,
purpose, and resilience.
