QUICK START GUIDE

For Content Editors (Non-Technical Users):
1. Read the EDITING-INSTRUCTIONS.md file - This contains everything you need to know
2. Always create a backup of history-json-based.html before making changes
3. Edit only the JSON data section (lines 302-491)
4. Test changes on a preview before publishing live

For Developers:
The project uses HTML injection into Chabad One CMS with the following components:
• Inline CSS styling (no external stylesheets allowed)
• Self-contained JavaScript for animations
• JSON-based data structure for easy content management
• Responsive design with mobile optimization


HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

Timeline Data Format:
The timeline events are stored in a simple JSON format:
{
  "YEAR": [
    "Event description 1",
    "Event description 2"
  ]
}

Three-Step Implementation Process:
1. CSS - Copy and paste into Chabad One "Header" or "Custom CSS" area
2. HTML - Copy and paste into Chabad One "Body" or "Content" area
3. JavaScript - Copy and paste into Chabad One "Footer" or "Custom JavaScript" area


FEATURES

Visual Design:
• Modern timeline with alternating left/right layout
• Animated entrance effects as users scroll
• Hover effects and interactive elements
• Golden color scheme with gradient accents
• Responsive mobile design

User Experience:
• Smooth scrolling navigation
• Intersection Observer animations
• Floating particle effects
• Mouse follower interaction
• Error handling for malformed JSON

Content Management:
• JSON-based data structure
• Non-technical user friendly
• Clear editing instructions
• Built-in error handling
• Automatic chronological sorting


CONTENT EDITING WORKFLOW

1. Open history-json-based.html in any text editor
2. Locate the JSON data section (lines 302-491)
3. Edit events using the simple JSON format
4. Save the file and test on preview
5. Deploy to Chabad One CMS


IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

Platform Constraints:
• Must work within Chabad One CMS limitations
• All code must be inline/embedded (no external files allowed)
• Compatible with CMS text editor injection

Editing Rules:
• Always use quotes around years and events
• Include commas between items (except the last item)
• Maintain proper bracket structure
• Save backups before making any edits


SUPPORT AND TROUBLESHOOTING

For Content Issues:
• Refer to EDITING-INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed guidance
• Verify JSON format using online validators
• Restore from backup if timeline functionality breaks

For Technical Issues:
• Review browser console for JavaScript errors
• Validate HTML structure in developer tools
• Check CSS compatibility with Chabad One platform


DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

This project was developed to provide:
1. Easy content management for non-technical JRCC staff
2. Professional timeline design within CMS constraints
3. Responsive user experience across all devices
4. Future-proof architecture for ongoing updates

The JSON-based approach allows content updates without requiring knowledge of HTML/CSS code, making it sustainable for long-term use by the JRCC team.
