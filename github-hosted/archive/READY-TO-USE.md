# Your Files Are Ready! 🎉

## Updated Files with Your GitHub URLs

I've updated both loader files with your actual GitHub repository URLs:

### URLs Being Used:
- **CSS**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Makra-ca/JRCC@main/github-hosted/jrcc-styles.css`
- **JS**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Makra-ca/JRCC@main/github-hosted/jrcc-scripts.js`

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Copy to Chabad One CMS

1. **For the Header:**
   - Open [custom-header-code-minimal.html](custom-header-code-minimal.html)
   - Copy ALL the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Go to your Chabad One CMS admin
   - Paste into the custom header field
   - Save

2. **For the Footer:**
   - Open [custom-footer-code-minimal.html](custom-footer-code-minimal.html)
   - Copy ALL the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Go to your Chabad One CMS admin
   - Paste into the custom footer field
   - Save

### Step 2: Test Your Website

After adding the code to CMS:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Check the Console tab - you should see:
   - `JRCC custom scripts loaded`
4. Check the Network tab to verify:
   - `jrcc-styles.css` loads successfully (200 status)
   - `jrcc-scripts.js` loads successfully (200 status)

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

Test these specific pages:
- ✅ Kosher Food Bank pages (Black/Gold theme)
- ✅ Volunteer form (Purple gradient)
- ✅ Scholarship form (Form enhancements)
- ✅ Sidebar functionality (Desktop hover, mobile drawer)

## File Size Reduction Achieved

| What | Before | After | Savings |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| Header | 1,327 lines | 68 lines | 95% |
| Footer | 2,225 lines | 23 lines | 99% |
| **TOTAL** | **3,552 lines** | **91 lines** | **97% smaller!** |

## Troubleshooting

If styles/scripts don't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the files exist in your GitHub repo
3. Make sure the repository is PUBLIC
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for CDN to cache the files

## Success! 🚀

Your CMS file size issue is now completely solved! The files are hosted on GitHub's CDN through jsDelivr, which means:
- ✅ No more CMS file size errors
- ✅ Fast global CDN delivery
- ✅ Easy updates through GitHub
- ✅ Version control for all changes
